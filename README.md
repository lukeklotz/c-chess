#NOTICE

This was mostly just a silly project I started years ago to practice writing some code in C.
This is by NO MEANS a functioning chess game or engine or any of that.
I had no idea how complex writing a fully functioning chess game would be until I started writing this.. LOL.

If anything, I learned how important it is to plan for atleast a few days before writing anything..

So anyway.. i'm just leaving it here for memories sake.
